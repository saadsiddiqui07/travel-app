Quality, functionality, good taste and sobriety, are some of the principles that inspire me, and i tried to furnish my apartment accordingly... a combination of antique and modern furniture, many plants and all the technology needed to make my flat convenient (high speed wi-fi, washing+drying machine, smart TV, internet radio, nice lights, etc.).\r\n\r\nI often go to Milan over the weekend which is when I mainly rent my flat.\r\nDifferently from other hosts that rent their properties for speculative reasons, I am just trying to have a little contribution to my monthly expenses and to allow other people enjoying Geneva while staying in a beautiful and convenient place. \r\nYou will notice that the quality of the furnitures is probably higher, the kitchen equipment is richer and, as an example, there are boardgames and all my books in a nice shelf in my room (with you can play with or read if you fancy).\r\nSo, I will be happy to share my apartment with you... as long as you commit to treat it with the care you would use with your own!",

It is famed for the large diamond shaped exhibition space where there is a local market on a Sunday and Wednesday.  It's also extremely close to the old town.  No more than a 10 minute walk which you can take through Parc de Bastion.  Lots of bars and restaurants nearby.",
    "notes": "The apartment is heated by a central heating system for the entire building.  Numerous radiators in every corner ensure that you\u2019ll always be cosy even on the coldest of Geneva winter nights. During the summer, the challenge is more keeping cool.  The numerous velux windows mean that the apartment can quite quite warm, however there are two large automatic roof vents that can be raised or lowered by wall-mounted buttons.   No need to worry about a pending light shower, as sensors ensure the vents will close automatically when rain is detected.  Thankfully relatively rare during the Geneva summer.",
    "transit": "Plainpalais is a real hub for trams and has the 15, 18 and 12 passing through.  very easy to get to shopping district and the lake (6 mins).  The airport is less than 25 mins by tram/train",
    "access": "The apartment is tucked away on the top floor (6th) of a large handsome building which enjoys a commanding position on the Rondpoint de Plainpalais.   A door code entry system allows access to the marble ground floor hallway and a traditional Schindler glass elevator.  Take the elevator to the 5th Floor and then walk one more flight of wooden steps to the penthouse floor.  The door is on the left handside at the top of the stairs.",

    "house_rules": "I\u2019d like you to feel as much at home as possible during your stay and keep rules to a bare minimum. Respecting neighbors is all I would ask by not slamming doors late at night.  In particular, please do tread lightly on the wooden floors when walking around the study area and the wardrobe dressing room late at night or early in the morning as this is directly above my downstairs neighbors bedroom. You\u2019re welcome to play the piano (up to 10:30pm at night) or use the remote controlled Sonos sound system, but please keep noise levels down when it gets later. One more rule.  Please don\u2019t open the velux windows beyond the horizontal as if there\u2019s a downpour, the rain water will flow in onto the floor.  Thanks.",
